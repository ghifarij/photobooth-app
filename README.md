This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Cloudinary Uploads and QR

The result page uploads the composed photostrip to Cloudinary and shows a QR that links to the shareable URL.

Configure one of the following for production:

- Signed upload via API route (recommended): set server env vars `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`.
- Unsigned client upload fallback: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` (an unsigned preset in your Cloudinary account). The app falls back to this if the signed route isnâ€™t configured.

Optional: `CLOUDINARY_FOLDER` to group uploads (e.g., `photobooth`). If using unsigned uploads, ensure the preset permits that folder or is preconfigured with one.
